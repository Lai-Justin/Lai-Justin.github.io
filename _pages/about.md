Hello! I’m Justin and I am a new graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Computer Science with an interest in machine learning and natural language processing. During the Summer of 2022, I interned at Sermonis.ai as a Machine Learning Engineer where I built natural language processing models to create intelligent virtual assistants for use in commercial and industrial purposes.

In the past, I worked at the University of California, San Francisco as a Frontend Web Developer and a Software QA Tester for the IndustryDocumentsLibrary and the Illios Project.

Besides computer science, some passions of mine are street photography as well as linguistics and language learning which fuels my interest in natural language processing. Along with English, I can speak Cantonese, French, German, and beginner-level Italian.

I am currently in search of a career in software development, data science, machine learning, cybersecurity, and project management. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions for me!

Projects
======
**CIFAR-10 Convolutional Neural Network Image Classifier**

[Github](https://github.com/Lai-Justin/Keras-CIFAR-10-CNN)

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images, with each of the images falling into one of ten different categories. These categories are: airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deers, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. Using this dataset, I created a convolutional neural network to create a machine learning image classifier to classify 10,000 of the images to the correct categorical label.

**Four-Year Schedule Planner**

[Github](https://github.com/Lai-Justin/Schedule-Planner)

In an effort to aid fellow incoming and current Gauchos at the UC Santa Barbara, I created a web application that allows students to more easily and conveniently schedule course schedules for every quarter of every year during their undergraduate career. The Four-Year Schedule Planner includes functionality such as specific major requirement auotfills, historical course grade distributions, and course search functionalities.

**Athlete Fitness Naïve Bayes' Classifier**

[Github](https://github.com/Lai-Justin/Schedule-Planner)

As a first attempt at Artificial Intelligence, I developed a program which classified and predicted the fitness of a person given their health information using the Naïve Bayes' Theorem. This was done by training a model using dataset contain the health information of 10,000 different athletes and health criteria such as weight, height, heart rate, and grip strength.

**Temperature-Based Automated Window Control Software**

[Github](https://github.com/Lai-Justin/Window-Control)

Inspired by a particularly hot summer in Berlin without air conditioning, I decided to create a device that could automatically maintain a cool temperture indoors during a heatwave without the use of air conditioning and fans as a proof of concept idea for people who are low-mobility or disabled. This was done using a RaspberryPi, heat sensors, motors, and a Python script connected to the National Weather Service API, among others.

**Fashion MNIST Convolutional Neural Network Image Classifier**

[Github](https://github.com/Lai-Justin/FashionMNIST-Image-Classifier)

A classic introduction into Deep Learning and Neural Networks, the Fashion MNIST dataset if a collection of 50,000 28x28 pixel greyscale images of 10 different categories of clothing. By creating and training a convolutional neural network, I was able to create a model that could identify and create correct predictions that classified what category of clothing that image contained.
